# RESTful Japanese Vacation as a Service
This repository is a fun side-project I came up with to practice Python and learn some Japanese for a future vacation.

### Container Ecosystem
To enjoy this vacation to the fullest, there should be as little stress as possible after arriving. To ensure this, I will create several RESTful microservices, each of which will perform a single function in planning the trip. These include:
1. day-planner (scheduler)
2. activity-repository (a bin for ideas)
3. language-practice (hiragana, katakana, kanji)
4. travel-planner (Google Maps integration or publicly-available transport data APIs for supporting day-planner functions)
5. various supporting services/databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL/etc)
